Simple project for a java interview

Create a webpage with one form and one text field that excepts user input

Only allow a-zA-Z in text field

Form will submit to restful service on server-side and return the string sent with the letters case reversed, i.e a becomes A and Z becomes z... or an error message

Points to note:
 User input must be validated before form is submitted.
 Error message should be displayed to user if input is invalid.
 Text entered should persist if not submitted.
 Server-side should validate input that was submitted, and respond with the input case reversed or an error message.
 The front end code should distinguish between an error response and a succesful response.
